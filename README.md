- 👋 Hi, I’m @ottobar, aka Don Barlow.
- 🤩 Three words to describe me: Trustworthy, Gritty, & Joyful!
- 👀 I’m interested in _all the things_, especially AI, AR/VR/XR, and the Web...however, there are only 24 hours in a day and I have a family.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything...everyone in this world knows something that you do not, so strive to find out what that is from them.
- 🏺 My favourite character from Greek Mythology: Cassandra, the Trojan priestess dedicated to the god Apollo and fated by him to utter true prophecies but never to be believed...I can relate. 
- 📫 How to reach me...I'm @ottobar on most things...but specifically
  - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ottobar/)
  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ottobar/)
  - [X](https://x.com/ottobar/)
- 🚲 I also think that non-electric bicycles should called “feature bikes,” similar to when smartphones came out and dumbphones were called “feature phones” as a euphemistic retronym. 🤷🏻‍♂️
