- 👋 Hi, I’m @ottobar
- 👀 I’m interested in _all the things_, especially AI and the Web...unfortunately, there are only 24 hours in a day and I have a family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to better communicate my brand and image to be more congruent with who I am, the values that I have, and the things that I do.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything...everyone in this world knows something that you do not, so try to find out what that is from them.
- 📫 How to reach me...I'm @ottobar on most things...but specifically:
  - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ottobar/)
  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ottobar/)
  - [X](https://x.com/ottobar/)
- 🚲 I also think that non-electric bicycles should called “feature bikes,” similar to when smartphones came out and dumbphones were called “feature phones” as a euphemistic retronym. 🤷🏻‍♂️
